# QA Testing Strategy: Customer Service Ticket Quality Score Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard displays quality scores for customer service tickets across three metrics: Customer Satisfaction, Agent Empathy, and Resolution Time. Users can adjust local viewing preferences (how they weight each metric) and lock those preferences to prevent accidental changes.

The backend calculates and sends the scores. The frontend lets users view and interact with that data. We test that the interface works reliably.

## What We Test

### 1. Slider Interaction
Users need to adjust how they view metrics. Sliders must respond accurately.

**Test:** Sliders move, display values update, constraints enforce (0-100 range).

### 2. Lock Mechanism
Users lock their viewing preferences during analysis so they don't accidentally change. Lock must work and persist.

**Test:** Lock button disables slider, visual state shows locked, lock survives reload.

### 3. Display Accuracy
Chart must render with correct data points, tooltips must show accurate date/score information.

**Test:** Chart renders, data points visible, score displays as valid number (0-100), tooltips appear on hover.

### 4. Persistence
User preferences (slider positions, lock states) must survive page reload so users don't lose their context.

**Test:** Adjust sliders, lock metrics, reload page, verify settings remain.

### 5. Responsive Design
Dashboard must work on desktop, tablet, and mobile without breaking.

**Test:** Layout holds on different viewports, controls remain functional.

## How We Scale

### Phase 1: Now (MVP)
**Focus:** Core functionality works reliably.

- 20 E2E tests covering slider interaction, lock, persistence, chart rendering
- Manual testing of edge cases
- Basic CI/CD (tests run on every PR)

Success: All tests pass, users can adjust and lock without issues.

### Phase 2: When Volume Matters (100K+ tickets/day)
**Focus:** Performance under load.

- Database query performance: trend queries <100ms p99
- Chart rendering: dashboard loads <2s even with full 14-day history
- Concurrent users: 50+ simultaneous requests stay responsive

Tools: Apache JMeter for load, Playwright for UI metrics

### Phase 3: Enterprise Scale (1M+ tickets/day)
**Focus:** Resilience and reliability.

- System behavior when backend is slow or unavailable
- Data consistency across distributed systems
- Graceful degradation if services fail

Tools: Chaos engineering, distributed tracing

## Tools

| What | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| E2E Tests | Playwright | Fast, reliable, excellent for UI interaction testing |
| Unit Tests | Jest | Backend algorithm validation |
| Load Testing | Apache JMeter | Simulates concurrent users, distributed load |
| Monitoring | Datadog/CloudWatch | Real-time performance tracking |

---

## CI/CD

- **Every PR:** Run 20 E2E tests (target <2 min)
- **Merge to main:** Full E2E + unit tests
- **Nightly:** Load tests at 1% of production scale
- **Weekly:** Performance baseline checks

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| E2E test pass rate | 100% locally, 95%+ CI | No regressions in core features |
| Slider responsiveness | <100ms | Users expect immediate feedback |
| Chart load time | <2s | Acceptable for SaaS dashboards |
| Persistence | 100% | Users never lose their preferences |
| Lock reliability | 100% | Users trust their settings stay locked |

---

## Summary

This is straightforward UI testing. Sliders work, lock works, chart displays, preferences persist, responsive design holds. The backend handles scoring. We test the interface.

20 E2E tests handle the critical paths. Load testing comes when you need it (Phase 2). No over-engineering.
